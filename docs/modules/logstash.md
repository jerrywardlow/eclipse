# Logstash

### Purpose
[Logstash](https://www.elastic.co/products/logstash) is an open-source tool for collecting, parsing, and storing logs for future use. Logstash will run alongside Kibana and Elasticsearch. 

### Dependencies
Java 8 is required, also Elasticsearch will need to be downloaded beforehand since Logstash is a plugin for Elasticsearch. Logstash can be downloaded as a Tarball, ZIP, DEB, and RPM through their [website](https://www.elastic.co/downloads/logstash). Please refer to their download instructions to download from package repositories on their [website](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/installing-logstash.html#package-repositories).
