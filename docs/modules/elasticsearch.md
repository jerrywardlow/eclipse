# Elasticsearch

### Purpose
[Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/) is a highly scalable open-source full-text search and analytics engine. Elasticsearch will run alongside [Logstash](https://www.elastic.co/products/logstash) and [Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/products/kibana) to create the Elastic stack, also known as the ELK stack.

### Dependencies
Elasticsearch is available to download in several different forms, including: ZIP, TAR, DEB, RPM, MSI, APT, and YUM.
Elasticsearch requires at least Java 8 to install. For more information, see [the docs](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/_installation.html)
