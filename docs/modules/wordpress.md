# WordPress

### Purpose

WordPress is a content management system geared primarily towards blogging.
More than 25% of the top 10 million websites use WordPress, with
over 60 million sites in total choosing the platform. WordPress is highly
customizable through a plugin and templating system, and is also free and
open-source, along for even greater customization of the core application.

### Dependencies

For most cases, this project being an example, WordPress requires an
installation of a LAMP stack. The core components of the LAMP stack are:
* Linux
* Apache
* MySQL
* PHP

This set of dependencies make up the core components required to install and
run WordPress. Installation of the WordPress application can be accomplished
via a simple archive extraction, detailed instructions of which can be found
