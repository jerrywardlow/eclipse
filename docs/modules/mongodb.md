# MongoDB

### Purpose

[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) is a document oriented database. It can be
classified as a NoSQL database. MongoDB stores information using a JSON-like
syntax. MongoDB is the standard database used in MEAN stack applications:
MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node.js.

[NodeBB](nodebb.md) uses MongoDB for document storage.

### Dependencies

MongoDB is supported on most modern platforms, including Ubuntu, Debian,
RHEL/CentOS, and Amazon Linux.

MongoDB binaries can be installed with no dependencies from a downloaded
tarball. In addition, public repositories are available to install Mongo as a
package. For more information, see [the docs](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-on-linux/).
